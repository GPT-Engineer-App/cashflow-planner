# cashflow-planner

Create a budgeting app that supports ALL the following user stories:

I want to add a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category (dropdown with e.g groceries, bills, salary), so that I can keep track of my financial activities.
I want to view a list of my transactions, showing details like date, amount, type, and category, so that I can quickly review my financial activities.
I want to edit an existing transaction's details in case I made an error or an update is needed, so that my transaction records are accurate.
I want to delete a transaction if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant, so that my financial records are up to date.
I want to filter transactions based on type (income/expense), category, or date range, so that I can find specific transactions or analyze my finances over a certain period.
I want to see my total balance, calculated as the sum of all income minus the sum of all expenses, so that I can have a quick overview of my financial health.
I want to export my transactions to a file (e.g, JSON) that I can save to my device, so that I can keep a backup or use the data in other applications.
